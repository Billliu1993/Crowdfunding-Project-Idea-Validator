Dice Dungeons is creating metal miniatures in the form of character coins. Our unique 12 pack sets of coins are perfectly sized for 1” battle mats and grids. Easy to transport, fun to use, and versatile - these coins are a must have for RPG fans, DMs on the run, or anyone who always wants to have their character easily available in their pocket! Once we reach our funding goal, we'll unlock our standard Character Coin Sets. In the base set backers will receive 12 coins - one of each of the barbarian, bard, cleric, druid, fighter, monk, paladin, ranger, rogue, sorcerer, warlock, and wizard. Flip the coins over to depict fallen characters with broken weapons, shields, or spellbooks. Backers also have the option of requesting that their set contain coins from only one class of characters if they prefer.
Going above and beyond our 10K goal unlocks even more Character Coin Sets. See the stretch goals below!  Each coin features exclusive art created in-house by Dice Dungeons. Sized for Standard Play. Each coin measures standard sizes for play, and fits within 1 inch grids. Characters coins are all sized as "medium" creatures - measuring 25mm.Unlock More Sets!
Our stretch goals will unlock more coin sets, to include NPCs and Monsters. For some monsters, we will make larger sized coins for Large, Huge, and Gargantuan creatures. Pick any of the unlocked coin sets when the Kickstarter closes. Most coins sets will contain 12 coins, unless noted on specialty large coin sets, such as the Dragon Set.
