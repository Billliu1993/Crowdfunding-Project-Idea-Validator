# Crowdfunding-Project-Idea-Validator
This repo contains the code for crowdfunding project idea validator, which is the final project for the NLP course in UCI MSBA program. We published the detailed desctiption of this project on Medium (https://medium.com/@xridgeteam/crowdfunding-project-idea-validator-using-natural-language-processing-375cffa560bb)

For the first-time runing of the code, feature_model.ipynb should be used in order to generate all of the essential model files for the idea validation tool.

Once all of the essential model files are generated, you can start trying this tool by running the run_model.ipynb file.
